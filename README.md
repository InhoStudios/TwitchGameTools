# TwitchGameTools
Our teams project for nwHacks 2020:

Twitch Game Tools is a proof of concept Twitch Chat command query API. As a framework, it allows game developers to easily implement a tool that will allow twitch streamers to interact with their twitch chat audience through their games.

It was built using Autocode to handle commands and queries, the Twitch bot API to handle messages and commands, and Node.js and Phaser 3 to create the back end and demo game.
